       oligodendroglioma.

ABSTRACT; Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells,
       evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental
       pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive
       tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for
       CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single
       cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing
       (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide
       expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along
       two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is
       undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells
       with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare
       subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible
       for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number
       variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar
       cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is
       primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis
       supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to 
       definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred
       hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular
       architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the
       cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.
