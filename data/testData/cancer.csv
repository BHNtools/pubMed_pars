TI  - Single-cell RNA-seq supports a developmental hierarchy in human
      oligodendroglioma.
LID - 10.1038/nature20123 [doi]
AB  - Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells,
      evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental
      pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive
      tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for
      CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single
      cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide
      expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along
      two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is
      undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells
      with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare
      subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible
      for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number
      variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar
      cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is
      primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis
      supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to 
      definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred
      hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular
      architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the
      cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.
